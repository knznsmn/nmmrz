# Setting Up An Environment on Android

I am using a handy and fast Huawei Y9 2019 Prime. I can't root it because of Huawei's weird policy for unlocking their smartphone's bootloaders but fotunately, I don't really need special privileges to set up development for coding practice, thanks to Termux.

## Setting Up
### Package Manager
F-Droid is the one-stop package manager for Android. Download [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/).

Through F-Droid, download the terminal emulator `Termux`.
[Termux](termux.md) (*Download from F-Droid repo. **F-Droid repository.***)

Most virtual keyboards that come with Android (these also includes Microsoft Swiftkey) is fine as Termux supplies the useful keys like ESC, TAB, and arrow keys independently. But there exists a keyboard that is so glorious I can't be sure if it's okay not to mention it here. Install it. 

[Unxpected Keyboard](https://f-droid.org/packages/juloo.keyboard2/). Install it. Install it now. It provides keys everyone should expect from anything that deems to be called a 'keyboard':
- ESC key
- Ctrl key
- and easy and quick access to enclosing symbols

Really. All the keys I expect in a keyboard. It's ironic the app is called 'Unexpected'. There must be some funny thoughts somewhere in that thought.
