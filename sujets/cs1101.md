# CS 1101: Programming Fundamentals

"*The course uses the Python programming language which is very simple and straightforward. The course also covers abstract concepts which can be applied to almost any programming language, and students are encouraged to pay attention to these, since the way of thinking like a programmer is the most valuable lesson they will learn.*"
