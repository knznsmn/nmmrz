- Models of computation, computability and decidability
- Design of computers and operating systems
- Information storage and retrieval from databases to hypertext
- Parallel and distributed computing
- Computer Networks and security
- Programming languages and methodologies
- Artificial Intelligence: techniques and challenges

### Setting Up
- Tools
	- Linux
	- Git
